# Please Note

These files should contain SCSS mixins, functions, variable definitions and other bits that **output no CSS.**
These files should _not output CSS_. This helps reduce bloat & keep pages snappy.

* These files will be included in every component and SCSS file by default (thx to `@nuxtjs/style-resources`)
